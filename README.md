Math For Machine learning
Explain the purpose of the GD algorithm in machine learning and optimization. 
Definition:
Gradient Descent (GD) is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a function by iteratively moving towards the steepest descent, i.e., the negative gradient of the function at the current point. It's widely used in machine learning to minimize cost functions, particularly in models like linear regression and neural networks.

Function requirements
Gradient descent algorithm does not work for all functions. There are two specific requirements. A function has to be:
•	differentiable
•	convex
